# 3D SVG Editor

> This is client side of 3D SVG Editor, a mini Adobe Illustrator with 3D editing capabilities for creating website assets.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

``` bash
npm install
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Electron window and "Developer Tools" is open.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import. See [Use NodeJS Native libraries](#use-nodejs-native-libraries) charpter if you want to import other native libraries in your project.
You can desactivate "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## To build for production

- Using development variables (environments/index.ts) :  `npm run electron:dev`
- Using production variables (environments/index.prod.ts) :  `npm run electron:prod`

Your built files are in the /dist folder.
